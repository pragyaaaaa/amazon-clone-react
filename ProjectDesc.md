# amazon-clone
Learning react involves a lot of code, I believe, just like learning any other technology or language.
So, in order to understand react better, this project was build using react, express, firebase (for authentication and cloud functions) and stripe(for payment)
What can be done in this clone:
  Signup
  Login
  Add product
  Remove product
  Display cart
  Checkout from cart
  View Orders (the stripe issue)

Stripe Issue: although, stripe has been integrated, there is something wrong with my account and I'm not able to get the secret from stripe.
